# Code Refactor Module Challenge 1

## Description

Refactored Horiseon's website code to make their website more accessible to facilitate the use of assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. By using semantic HTML elements and image alt attributes the website becomes more accessible to the public and is ultimately optimized for search engines. My motivation and what I learned while completing this project is to continue setting the example of creating user friendly websites to the whole public. 

## Code Refactors

- Replaced all non-semantic elements to semantic elements on HTML.
- Linked CSS style sheet and replaced all non semantic elements to it's appropriate element.
- Refactored CSS classes to eliminate duplicate code.
- Added a descriptive title.

- Reorganized CSS file.

- Added alts to all images.
- Added proper comments to CSS file.
